Each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with the arbitration, except that the fees assessed by the AAA for the services of the arbitrator will be divided equally by the parties. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees which are reasonably incurred by the other party.

User’s use of any materials or reports provided by the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.
  MISCELLANEOUS. This EULA applies to updates, supplements, modifications, enhancements, or service components of the Services that S4 may provide or make available to User after the date User obtains the initial copy of the Services, unless they are accompanied by separate terms. This EULA is the entire agreement between User and S4 relating to the Services and supersedes all prior EULAs or agreements and all other prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Services. S4 reserves the right to discontinue providing the Services at any time. The failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this EULA shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. If any provision of this EULA shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law, and the remaining provisions of this EULA shall remain in full force and effect.
